# Phase 4 Study Guide


1. What is a server? What are routes? What are RESTful routes? What are dynamic routes? What is CRUD?

```
```

2. What is a model? How does it relate to python and databases? What does the command `flask db migrate -m "new message"` do? What is a migration? What does the command `flask db upgrade` do?

```
```

3. How can we introduce a relationship between two models? (HINT: What columns and special code do those models need?)  What is the difference between a one to many and a many to many?

```
```

4. What does it mean to serialize our data and why do we do it? What does `to_dict` do? What package creates our `to_dict` for us?

```
```

5. What are validations? How do we add a validation to a model?

```
```

6. There will be a debugging section. To prepare for this, assume you will either have to debug a model or a route that has invalid code.
